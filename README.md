In this section, we will create this advanced functionality using an image processing technique known as color detection and segmentation. This works using the live camera stream.

The implementation requires a cloth of uniform color, devoid of any other visible hues. In this demonstration, a red cloth will be utilized. If a cloth of a different color is selected, the underlying code will necessitate minor modifications to accommodate the new color parameters. These adjustments involve altering the color range values used in the detection and segmentation algorithms to match the hue, saturation, and value (HSV) of the new cloth color.
